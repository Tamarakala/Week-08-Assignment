<p>A growth mindset is simply the belief that our basic abilities can be developed and improved through dedication and hard work.</p>
<p>A growth mindset is a concept developed by psychologist Carol Dweck in her research on achievement and success. It refers to the belief 
that abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort, learning, and perseverance. 
In contrast, a fixed mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence are static traits that cannot be changed significantly.</p>
